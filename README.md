### ðŸŒ± Project Overview

This project is a classic implementation of Conway's **Game of Life**, a cellular automaton that simulates simple life and death cycles in a grid, creating complex patterns from simple rules.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaurianeGelebart/Game_of_life.git
   ```

2. **Open the project** in Unity (version 2022.3.4f1 or later recommended).

3. **Run the project** to start the simulation.

### ðŸ”§ Customizing the Simulation

ðŸ’¡ Experiment with parameters in the `Grid` script to explore new behaviors in the Game of Life!
 
Adjust the **Tile color** to differentiate between live and dead cells.

You can also modify the different **initial patterns**, the default pattern is the "Pentomino-R".
